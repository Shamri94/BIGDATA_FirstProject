# BIGDATA_FirstProject
First project for the course of Big Data at 'Universit√† degli Studi Roma Tre'. This repository contains 3 jobs in Hadoop map-reduce using Python.

To run any map-reduce job just execute any script using 'bash startJob.sh'. In this repository there are script that I executed locally and script that I executed in the AWS cluster.
